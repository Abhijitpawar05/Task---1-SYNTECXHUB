1️⃣ Imported Required Libraries

I started by importing the necessary libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and time for performance comparison.

2️⃣ Created NumPy Arrays

I created different types of arrays including:

1D arrays

2D arrays

Arrays filled with zeros and ones

Randomly generated arrays

This helped me understand how NumPy handles multidimensional data efficiently.

3️⃣ Performed Indexing and Slicing

I accessed specific elements and subarrays using indexing and slicing techniques.
This allowed me to retrieve rows, columns, and subsets of data from arrays.

4️⃣ Applied Mathematical Operations

I performed element-wise mathematical operations such as:

Addition

Multiplication

Square root

Power calculations

This demonstrated NumPy’s ability to perform vectorized operations efficiently.

5️⃣ Executed Axis-wise Operations

I calculated row-wise and column-wise:

Sum

Mean

Using the axis parameter, I understood how operations can be applied across different dimensions of the array.

6️⃣ Conducted Statistical Analysis

I applied statistical functions such as:

Mean

Median

Standard Deviation

Maximum

Minimum

This helped in analyzing data distributions within arrays.

7️⃣ Implemented Reshaping and Broadcasting

I reshaped arrays into different dimensions using the reshape() function.
I also applied broadcasting to perform operations between arrays of different shapes efficiently.

8️⃣ Saved and Loaded NumPy Arrays

I used:

np.save() to store arrays

np.load() to retrieve saved arrays

This demonstrated file handling capabilities in NumPy.

9️⃣ Compared Performance with Python Lists

I compared execution time between:

Python lists

NumPy arrays

The results showed that NumPy performs significantly faster due to vectorized operations and optimized internal implementation.

🔟 Performed Mini Dataset Analysis

I created a small dataset (e.g., student marks) and applied statistical analysis to:

Find average marks

Identify highest and lowest scores

Filter values based on conditions

This simulated a real-world data analysis scenario.
